# **NeuroFleetX – AI-Driven Urban Mobility Optimization**

**NeuroFleetX** is an AI-driven urban mobility optimization platform designed to simulate real-world fleet intelligence, operational decision-making, predictive maintenance, and urban mobility workflows.
The system blends a visually rich **React UI**, a structured **Spring Boot API**, and a reliable **PostgreSQL** database to demonstrate how modern mobility services, rental systems, or fleet networks can be managed, analyzed, and optimized.

## ⚙️ **Robust Backend API & Domain Logic**

* Unified `/api` endpoints for all core modules
* Clean JSON responses with strong validation and predictable error handling
* Demo-mode authentication for quick testing
* Expanded domain models:

  * **Vehicles:** registration, owner, condition, operational status
  * **Bookings:** customer details, schedule, vehicle link, assignment
  * **Maintenance:** service logs, cost tracking, technician info
* Updated and optimized entity relationships for PostgreSQL
* Stable controllers across vehicles, bookings, maintenance, and auth

---

## 🗄️ **PostgreSQL Database & Schema Evolution**

* PostgreSQL-optimized tables with clean mapping
* `schema.sql` + `data.sql` + `data-v2.sql` for repeatable initialization
* Safe incremental migrations using `ALTER IF NOT EXISTS`
* Fixes for mismatches from previous development cycles
* Designed for consistent rebuilds during active development
